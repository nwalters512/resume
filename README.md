resume
======

This is my resume, a living document that describes my accomplishments to date. Its design is based on [Adrien Friggeri](<https://github.com/afriggeri/>)â€™s beautiful template that can be found [here](<http://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv>).


**Important:** This must be compiled with XeLaTeX an relies on a number of 3rd-party packages. I use [MiKTeX ](<http://miktex.org/>)on Windows to edit and compile the LaTeX document; it also includes a package manager that makes downloading and installing the required packages very easy. Similar applications should be available on other platforms.
